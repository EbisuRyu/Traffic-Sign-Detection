## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EbisuRyu/Traffic_Sign_Detection.git
   ```

### Method 1: Using HOG Features and SVM Classifier

- Data preparation and model training process are presented in the `svm_training.ipynb` file.
- Detection of traffic signs using the trained SVM classifier is demonstrated in the `svm_hog_detection.ipynb` file.

### Method 2: Using Faster RCNN Model

- The training and evaluation of the Faster RCNN model are detailed in the `fasterRCNN.ipynb` file.
